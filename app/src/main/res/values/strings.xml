        This calculator will help you figure out how to increase or decrease evenly across a row. \n\n
        The first method will typically be easier but may result in a non-symmetric increase/decrease. However, for most projects this will be fine. \n\n
        The second method will be more balanced and will try to be as symmetric as possible around the centre stitch.

        This calculator will estimate the weight of yarn you will need as well as the number of skeins. \n\n
        You will need to input the relevant information which can usually be found on the ball label of your skein. \n\n
        If it isn\'t there it may be possible for you to find it on https://www.ravelry.com
